# g95-Database
## Welcome to the step-by-step instructions for building our very own g95 database and server with Node, Express, Knex, and Postgresql!
---
## Wednesday

Today we're going to start by creating some student data objects, changing our migrations, and adding to our seeds.
  - First thing first, everyone should create an object for themselves and slack it out in ONE thread.
  - Here's the format should be:
    ```{firstName: '', lastName: '', hometown: '', prevOccupation: '', favoriteNum: int, pastime: ''}```
  - Once you've done that and you're all caught up with what we did yesterday, it's time to change our seeds and migrations to match this new data format.
  - When changing your migration, remember that we HAVE to have an id:
    ```entityInTable.increments('id')```
  - We _don't_ have to add an id into our student objects because it's done automatically once you set that column up in the migration.
  - We _do_ need to add columns for all these new keys we expect our entities to have.
  - Using the added resource about knex columns in the __Migrations__ section, add the appropriate columns to your migration file.
  - Once you're done, rollback your original migration, then RUN THE LATEST ONE!
  - It worked? IT WORKED!
  - Add. Commit. Push.ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
  ---
  
  Next we need to take all the data from Slack, and paste it into our seed file.
  - Hopefully, everyone copy and pasted the code snippet, and the format is the same throughout.
  - Paste each student entity into your seed file, check for formatting errors, then... RUN THE SEED!
  - Now we have WAY more data in our database.
  - Add, commit, and puuuuuush! ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
  ---
  Now, I want you to write another query and another route.
  - This query and route will be used to get a student by their first name and send it to the client.
  
  ### Get By Name Query
  - In your queries file, go ahead and make a new query function called 'read'
  - read will take one parameter, firstName
    ```read(firstName){}```
  - In this query, we're going to want to return the entity in the table where firstName is equal to firstName
  - Using the resources I added for writing queries (in the Writing Queries section), and the knowledge you have about basic query structure, finish this one on your own.
  - I will add a code snippet later on.
  
  ### Get By Name Route
  We've written our query, so let's go back to our app.js and make use of it!
  - Make another get route, but this time we're going to do something a little bit different
  ```app.get('/:firstName', (request, response) => {})```
  - Notice the difference? There's now a colon in our route, this is allows us to access that piece of the url and pass it into our query
  - To see this, I just want you to console.log(request.params) within that route.
  ```app.get('/:firstName', (request, response) => console.log(request.params)```
  - Run it, and in the browser, go to localhost:yourPort/asdf
  - Check the console, and you should see something like this: ```{firstName: asdf}```
  - Guess how we can use this in our query!!!!
  - Delete your console.log, bring in the new query you wrote, and pass it ```req.params.firstName```
  - Follow the pattern from the previous get route!
  - Once you're done, go to localhost:yourPort/Joey and see if it works!
  - If all went well, you should now be able to grab a student by their first name!!!
  - WOO! Add, commit, push. ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…

## Tuesday
  We're going to start off by creating a basic server with Node and Express.
  - Create a new folder from within your terminal!
  - Navigate into that folder
  - We need to do three things right off the bat, create a package.json, set up a git repository, and create an app.js
    - ```npm init```
    - ```git init```
    - ```touch app.js```
  - Navigate to your github and create a new repository
    - Copy the link for your git repository
    - Go to your terminal and add a new remote called origin
    - ```git remote add origin URL```
  - Go ahead and add your project, commit, and push to your repo ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
  ---
 
### Express Setup
  Let's get that express server running!
  - Remember what basic dependencies our express server needs?
  - ```npm install express```, that's it!
  - Now build out that basic express server the way we have done before.
    - Create a const called express that requires in express
    - Create another const called app that invokes express
    - Create another const called port that equals ```process.env.PORT``` OR ```whatever port you want it to run on```
    - A tiny bit of information on why you use process.env.PORT [heroku docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/runtime-principles#web-servers)
    - Tell express() to listen to port and then pass in an anonymous function with ```console.log(`listening on ${port}`)``` or something like that.
  - RUN IT AND SEE IF IT WORKS!
    - ```$node app.js```
  - All good? Add, commit, and push to github. ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
  ---
    
  Lets write a basic get route now.
  - Below your app.listen give it an ```app.get()```
  - We're going to pass in the route, which will be the base route ```'/'```
  - We're also going to pass in an anonymous function with two parameters, request and response
  - ES5: ```function(request, response){}```
  - ES6: ```(request, response) => {}```
  - Inside of that function, we're going to send a response ```res.send()
  - We'll send back... something... how about ```('THE ROUTE WORKED!')```
  - RUN IT! 
  - Worked? Hooray! Add. Commit. Push. ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
  ---

### Knex and PostgreSQL setup (in project)
  Now that we have our basic express server together, we're going to start messing with knex and postgresql
  - Go back to your terminal and ```npm install knex pg```
    - You can install multiple dependencies in one line ðŸ˜Š
  - We also need to create a database
    - ```createdb DATABASE_NAME_THAT_MAKES_SENSE_FOR_G95_DATABASE```
  - Okay... We have our dependencies installed and have created a database. What's next?
  - ```knex init```
    - This will create a file called 'knexfile.js'
  - Take a look at that file. It's a configuration file, and it has a bunch of keys within a module.exports, which will make them available to files outside of your knexfile.
  - You'll notice that the top level keys are: development, staging, and production
  - We're not going to mess with staging. Go ahead and delete everything within that key, leaving development and production
  - Also notice that both are using 'sqlite3' as their client. Well, we're not. We're using postgresql.
  - Change the client on both development and production to: ```'pg'```
  - We're also going to need to change the connection for both of them.
    - Connection for development: ```connection: 'postgresql://localhost/DATABASE_NAME_THAT_MAKES_SENSE_FOR_G95_DATABASE```
    - Connection for production: ```connection: process.env.DATABASE_URL```
  - Delete the rest of the key: value pairs, leaving only client and connection for both. We won't need the extra information.
  - Knex is now configured for development and production! ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
  - Add. Commit. Push.
  ---
  
### Migrations
  Next, lets make our migrations and seeds
  
  - ```knex migrate:make students```
  - This will make a migration file, the long string of digits before "students" is a timestamp. These files run in chronological order.
  - Open this file (it's in the migrations folder)
  - You'll notice that there are two sections: _exports.up_ and _exports.down_
  - _exports.up_ will be run with ```knex migrate:latest```
    - This command will create the table and the schema
  - Inside your exports.up, you'll need to write the code to create the table and to create the columns and datatypes (schema) in that table
  - ```return knex.schema.createTable('table_name', (entityInTable) => {}```
  - You'll notice that createTable takes two arguments, the name of your table, and an anonymous function
  - 'entityInTable' is in place of whatever you want to call a specific entity in your table
    - For instance, if your table is named 'students', a good specific entity-name would be 'student'.
  - Inside of the curlies is where you write the code to create your columns.
  - Your table ALWAYS needs a primary key, more info about [primary keys](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-primary-key/)
  - ```entityInTable.increments('id')```
  - Here's some info about column types with [knex](https://knexjs.org/#Schema-Building).
  - And here's an example with the id column included in the migration:
  ```javascript
    return knex.schema.createTable('table_name', (entityInTable) => {
      entityInTable.increments('id')
    }
  ```
  - Add. Commit. Push.ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
  ---

### Seeds
  - ```knex seed:make 01_students```
  - Your seeds will run in alphabetical order, so their names need to help specify their order.
  - If you look at your seed file you'll see something like this:
    ```javascript
    exports.seed = function(knex, Promise) {
    // Deletes ALL existing entries
      return knex('table_name').del()
      .then(function () {
    // Inserts seed entries
        return knex('table_name').insert([
          {id: 1, colName: 'rowValue1'},
          {id: 2, colName: 'rowValue2'},
          {id: 3, colName: 'rowValue3'}```
         ]);
        });
       };```
  - You will replace ```table_name``` with the name of the table you wish to run this seed on. Pretty simple, right?
  - If you used ```entityInTable.increments('id')```, you won't need to pass an id into your seed file. It will assign that automatically.
  - Make sure that your column names match between your migration file and your seed file! Copy+paste!
  - Everything behaving the way it should? Add. Commit. Push.ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…

  ### Queries Setup
  We now have a new table in our database, with a schema, and some data. Lets make some queries with Knex to reach into that database and grab some data for us.
  - We'll start by creating a queries file in the top level of our project called queries.js.
  - Now, we need to require in our knexfile.js. BUT, we don't want to import all of it.
    - We want to import only the production config OR the development config.
    - When we deploy to Heroku, Heroku creates an environment variable (accessed with process.env) called ```NODE_ENV```
    - If our database is being hosted on Heroku, by default that variable will evaluate to ```'production'```.
    - We don't want to write ```'production'```, because the only time we want it to run the production configuration is when it's actually hosted on Heroku.
  - So, we want to import the correct configuration of knex.
  - That line of code looks like this:
    ```const connection = require('./knexfile)[process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'] ```
  - Remember, our knexfile exports an object, and we can use [bracket] notation to dive into that object.
  - Next we need to create another variable that will bring in the knex library and give it that connection as well
    ```const database = require('knex')(connection)```
  - With those two variables in place, we can start writing our queries
  - Create a module.exports statement, like this:
    ```module.exports = {}```
  - Inside of those curlies is where we will write our queries.ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
  
  ---
  ### Writing Queries
  Our queries file is set up, so lets go ahead and write our first query.
  - We'll call it: listAll
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      listAll(){
            
      }
    }```
  - Inside of ALL of your queries, you will start with a ```return```
  - Since we want to list all of the entities in our database, we can just return the the whole table
    ``` return database('students')```
  - We're saying database only because that's what we named the variable in our Knex setup step
  - THATS IT!
  - Each query we write will share a very similar form. We don't need a function keyword before function name, and we always start with a return.ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…

  ### Running Queries with Express
  We've now written our first query, so lets use it to serve some data through our Express server!
  - Go back to app.js
  - Towards the top, where we were requiring in Express and invoking it, we want to also require in our queries file.
    ```const queries = require('./queries')```
  - Now we have access to everything within the module.exports inside of queries.js!
  - Inside of the app.get we wrote when setting up the server, we're going to utilize that query.
  - Delete: ```res.send('THE ROUTE WORKED')```
  - Now we will call our query, and send the data back to the client:
    ```queries.listAll().then(students => res.send(students))```
  - Save, and run it! If you don't remember where to go once it's running, check the port number you assigned at the top of your app.js
  - DID YOU GET THE DATA? YOU GOT THE DATA!
  - Add. Commit. Push. ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
