# g95-Database
## Welcome to the step-by-step instructions for building our very own g95 database and server with Node, Express, Knex, and Postgresql!

## Tuesday
  We're going to start off by creating a basic server with Node and Express.
  - Create a new folder from within your terminal!
  - Navigate into that folder
  - We need to do three things right off the bat, create a package.json, set up a git repository, and create an app.js
    - ```npm init```
    - ```git init```
    - ```touch app.js```
  - Navigate to your github and create a new repository
    - Copy the link for your git repository
    - Go to your terminal and add a new remote called origin
    - ```git remote add origin URL```
  - Go ahead and add your project, commit, and push to your repo ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…

### Express Setup
  Let's get that express server running!
  - Remember what basic dependencies our express server needs?
  - ```npm install express```, that's it!
  - Now build out that basic express server the way we have done before.
    - Create a const called express that requires in express
    - Create another const called app that invokes express
    - Create another const called port that equals ```process.env.PORT``` OR ```whatever port you want it to run on```
    - A tiny bit of information on why you use process.env.PORT [heroku docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/runtime-principles#web-servers)
    - Tell express() to listen to port and then pass in an anonymous function with ```console.log(`listening on ${port}`)``` or something like that.
  - RUN IT AND SEE IF IT WORKS!
    - ```$node app.js```
  - All good? Add, commit, and push to github. ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…

  Lets write a basic get route now.
  - Below your app.listen give it an ```app.get()```
  - We're going to pass in the route, which will be the base route ```'/'```
  - We're also going to pass in an anonymous function with two parameters, request and response
  - ES5: ```function(request, response){}```
  - ES6: ```(request, response) => {}```
  - Inside of that function, we're going to send a response ```res.send()
  - We'll send back... something... how about ```('THE ROUTE WORKED!')```
  - RUN IT! 
  - Worked? Hooray! Add. Commit. Push. ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…

### Knex and PostgreSQL setup (in project)
  Now that we have our basic express server together, we're going to start messing with knex and postgresql
  - Go back to your terminal and ```npm install knex pg```
    - You can install multiple dependencies in one line ðŸ˜Š
  - We also need to create a database
    - ```createdb DATABASE_NAME_THAT_MAKES_SENSE_FOR_G95_DATABASE```
  - Okay... We have our dependencies installed and have created a database. What's next?
  - ```knex init```
    - This will create a file called 'knexfile.js'
  - Take a look at that file. It's a configuration file, and it has a bunch of keys within a module.exports, which will make them available to files outside of your knexfile.
  - You'll notice that the top level keys are: development, staging, and production
  - We're not going to mess with staging. Go ahead and delete everything within that key, leaving development and production
  - Also notice that both are using 'sqlite3' as their client. Well, we're not. We're using postgresql.
  - Change the client on both development and production to: ```'pg'```
  - We're also going to need to change the connection for both of them.
    - Connection for development: ```connection: 'postgresql://localhost/DATABASE_NAME_THAT_MAKES_SENSE_FOR_G95_DATABASE```
    - Connection for production: ```connection: process.env.DATABASE_URL```
  - Delete the rest of the key: value pairs, leaving only client and connection for both. We won't need the extra information.
  - Knex is now configured for development and production! ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…

### Migrations
  Next, lets make our migrations and seeds
  
  - ```knex migrate:make students```
  - This will make a migration file, the long string of digits before "students" is a timestamp. These files run in chronological order.
  - Open this file (it's in the migrations folder)
  - You'll notice that there are two sections: _exports.up_ and _exports.down_
  - _exports.up_ will be run with ```knex migrate:latest```
    - This command will create the table and the schema
  - Inside your exports.up, you'll need to write the code to create the table and to create the columns and datatypes (schema) in that table
  - ```return knex.schema.createTable('table_name', (entityInTable) => {}```
  - You'll notice that createTable takes two arguments, the name of your table, and an anonymous function
  - 'entityInTable' is in place of whatever you want to call a specific entity in your table
    - For instance, if your table is named 'students', a good specific entity-name would be 'student'.
  - Inside of the curlies is where you write the code to create your columns.
  - Your table ALWAYS needs a primary key, more info about [primary keys](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-primary-key/)
  - ```entityInTable.increments('id')```
  - Here's some info about column types with [knex](https://knexjs.org/#Schema-Building).
  - And here's an example with the id column included in the migration:
  ```javascript
    return knex.schema.createTable('table_name', (entityInTable) => {
      entityInTable.increments('id')
    }
  ```
  ---

### Seeds
  - ```knex seed:make 01_students```
  - Your seeds will run in alphabetical order, so their names need to help specify their order.
  - If you look at your seed file you'll see something like this:
    ```javascript
    exports.seed = function(knex, Promise) {
    // Deletes ALL existing entries
      return knex('table_name').del()
      .then(function () {
    // Inserts seed entries
        return knex('table_name').insert([
          {id: 1, colName: 'rowValue1'},
          {id: 2, colName: 'rowValue2'},
          {id: 3, colName: 'rowValue3'}```
         ]);
        });
       };```
  - You will replace ```table_name``` with the name of the table you wish to run this seed on. Pretty simple, right?
  - If you used ```entityInTable.increments('id')```, you won't need to pass an id into your seed file. It will assign that automatically.
  - Make sure that your column names match between your migration file and your seed file! Copy+paste!

  ### Queries
  We now have a new table in our database, with a schema, and some data. Lets make some queries with Knex to reach into that database and grab some data for us.
  - We'll start with
